Display a clock with 3 times with a widget on the home screen in mobile devices.

First time in digits: clock with the UTC time (HH:MM:SS)
Second time in digits: clock with the calculated local sundial time (HH:MM:SS)

Calculating:

- get the longitude from GPS.
- calculate the equation of time with the timestamp. (formular available).
- calculate the difference to UTC with the longitude (1 hour = 15Â°).
